-------------------------------------------------------------------
We should do some work before use `videojs-contrib-dash`

```
  cd ./node_modules/videojs-contrib-dash

  // this command will run `grunt build`, but there is no `test` directory, so delete `test options` in `gruntfile.js`
  npm install

  // we should annotate some code in /src/videojs-dash.js
  grunt build
```

As well use `videojs-contrib-hls`

```
  cd ./node_modules/videojs-contrib-hls

  npm install
```
